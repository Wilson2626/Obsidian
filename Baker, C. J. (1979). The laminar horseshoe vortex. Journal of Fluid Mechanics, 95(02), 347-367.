1. junction of an aeroplane wing with the fuselage
# Abstract
1. Pressure distributions
2. variation of the horseshoe vortex position position
3. Using smoke flow visualization techniques
# 1. Introduction
1. cylinder produces pressure gradients in its vicinity.

2. The boundary layer on the wall upstream of the cylinder is in a region of [adverse pressure gradient] --> three-dimensional separation

3. The separated boundary layer rolls up downstream of
	the separation line to form a system of vortices. 
	1. figure 1 (plate 1) [taken by E. P. Sutton and printed in Thwaites (1960)]

4. This vortex system is swept around the base of the cylinder and assumes a [characteristic shape] which has led to its name - the horseshoe vortex.

5. A horseshoe vortex system will [produce high wall shear stresses beneath it]
	1. around a bridge pier in the sand bed of a river --> cause the bed to be eroded and a scour hole to form around the base of the obstacle.

6. [Schwind (1962)]
	1. regime 1：type flow only a very weak, slowly rotating vortex is
		formed
	2. regime 2：single steady clockwise
		rotating vortex and a small triangular-shaped counter-rotating vortex visible
	3. regime 3：The need for velocity gradients to be continuous implies that a second vortex rotating in the same direction as the main vortex must be present upstream of the small counter rotating vortex
	4.  regime 4&5：regular oscillatory motion was observed with the main vortex apparently becoming isolated from the rest of the vortex system and moving towards the wedge, then moving back upstream.
