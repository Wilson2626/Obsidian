# 1. Introduction
1. cylinder produces pressure gradients in its vicinity.

2. The boundary layer on the wall upstream of the cylinder is in a region of ~={purple}adverse pressure gradient] --> three-dimensional separation=~

3. The separated boundary layer rolls up downstream of
	the separation line to form a system of vortices.  --> This vortex system is swept around the base of the cylinder and assumes a ~={purple}characteristic shape=~ which has led to its name - the horseshoe vortex.

4. A horseshoe vortex system will ~={purple}produce high wall shear stresses beneath it=~

	1. a) regime 1：type flow only a very weak, slowly rotating vortex is formed

	2. b) regime 2：single steady clockwise
		rotating vortex and a small triangular-shaped counter-rotating vortex visible
		![[b) regime2.png]]

	3. c) regime 3：The need for velocity gradients to be continuous implies that a second vortex rotating in the same direction as the main vortex must be present upstream of the small counter rotating vortex
		![[c) regime3.png]]
	4.  d&e) regime 4&5：regular oscillatory motion was observed with the main vortex apparently becoming isolated from the rest of the vortex system and moving towards the wedge, then moving back upstream.

# 3. Experimental apparatus
1.  a) Flow visualization：carried out in a Smoke tunnnel, cylinder was  mounted on a plate on the centre-line of the tunnel working section
	1. The values of the non-dimensional variables quoted for tests in this tunnel should only be regarded as approximate because of ~={purple}wall interference effectes.=~
2.  b) Pressure measurement：It can be seen that the form parameter H is approximately equal to the value for boundary-layer growth on a flat plate in zero pressure gradient.
3.  c) Measurements of vortex oscillations：DISA hot-wire ‘u’ probes were inserted through a small hole in the wind tunnel wall beneath the horseshoe vortex system, so that the tips of the probes just extended into the flow.
4.  d) Velocity measurements：A frame-by-frame analysis of the films was then carried out and, by measuring the difference in position of the ends of the smoke filament between successive frames, the flow velocity within nearly all the regions of the vortex system could be determined.
# 4. Flow visualization results
### 4.1 Gerneral description of horseshoe vortex flows
1. The exact number of vortices was seen to depend upon the flow speed and cylinder size, more vortices appearing as the
speed increased
2.  above a certain flow speed the entire horseshoe vortex system began to oscillate in a regular manner with the two largest clockwise rotating vortices moving towards one another and apart again.
3. at higher speeds the largest clockwise rotating vortex ceased to be fed by smoke during part of the oscillation period and seemed to become detached from the rest of the vortex system.
4. at still higher speeds the flow appeared to he very unsteady and turbulent and showed no traces of periodicity
### 4.2 Detailed description of steady horseshoe vortices
![[Paper系列/Baker, C. J. (1979). The laminar horseshoe vortex. Journal of Fluid Mechanics, 95(02), 347-367./Figure 4..png]]

![[Figure 5..png]]

3. It can be seen that the number of vortices that were observable increases as UDlv and D/S* increase

### 4.3. Detailed description of oscillating horseshoe vortex systems

![[Figure 8..png]]

3.  As vortex1 moves towards the cylinder vortex 1’ must move with it, since it is caused by separation under vortex1  Since the effect of vortex1’ on vortex2 is to pull it down onto the plate (figure9b) when vortex1‘ moves away from vortex2 , vortex2 rises from the plate (frames 3 to10). In a similar manner when vortex1 (and hence vortex1‘) moves back towards vortex2, vortex1‘ influences vortex2 to a greater extent and vortex2 moves back towards the plate (frames11 to 14).

# 5. Plane of symmetry pressure measurements
1. There are two types of distribution. 
	1. For $UD/v < 5000$, the curves have minima
	2. while for $UD/v > 5000$ no minima can be seen.
	
2. As $UD/\nu$ and $D/\delta^{*}$ increase $C_{p}$ at $x/D = -0.5$ also increases.
		![[Figure 10..png]]

3. it can be seen that the vortex moves away from the model as $D/\delta^{*}$decreases.
		![[Figure 11..png]]
# 6. Variation of the horseshoe vortex position
1. As $UD/v < 5000$ increases, $x_{v}/D$ increases and, as $D/\delta^{*}$ increases, $x_{v}/D$ decreases.
		![[Figure 12..png]]

# 7. The oscillatory behaviour of horseshoe vortex systems
1. At any one speed four different waveforms could be seen at different times:
	1. a) a steady trace with no oscillations
	2. b) a low frequency oscillation $(St = fD/U = 0.26)$
	3. c) a high frequency oscillation ($St = 0.4$, increasing to about $0.6$ at higher $UD/\nu$)
	4. d) an irregular turbulent trace
2. The spectra obtained are shown in figures 13(a) and 13(b). 
		![[Figure 13..png]]
3. 
		![[Figure 14..png]]

4. Also it can be seen from figure15(a) that the Strouhal number for ~={purple}the wake vortex shedding of the cylinder is approximately 0.16 at all tunnel speeds, which bears no relationship to the observed frequencies of oscillation of the horseshoe vortex systems.=~Thus it appears that one can eliminate wake vortex shedding as a possible cause of the oscillations.		![[Figure 15..png]]
# 8. Velocity measurements in the smoke tunnel
1. Velocity proliles and their positions.
	1. Radial flow component was mesured in two ways
		a) resolving the flow velocity at the measursment sections in a radial direction.
		b) measuring the variation of the distance of a streamline from the vortex centre between two successive crossings by the streamline of the measurement section.	
		c) The latter method effectively gives mean radial velocity for half a streamline spiral around the vortex. However, these methods gave more or less identical results close to the centre of the vortices.		
		![[Figure 16.(a).png]]
		![[Figure 16.(b).png]]
2. Figure 17 shows that the non-dimensional velocity profiles do not vary greatly in and beneath the vortex core. 
		![[Figure 17..png]]
	1. as $UD/\nu$ increases vortex1 moves away from the cylinder to a position where the dimensionless velocity outside the vortex system is higher.
	2. 
3. Figure 18 the distribution of skin friction beneath the horseshoe vortex system is shown
		![[Figure 18..png]]
	3. The dotted lines in the figure indicate a region where the skin friction could not be measured.
	4. The most striking feature of this figure is the high value of $|C_{f}|$ beneath vortex1.
	5. Thus although over much of the vortex system on the $|C_{f}|$plane of symmetry there is a reduction in from its freestream value, there is a $|C_{f}|$ considerable increase in beneath vortex 1.
# 9. Conclusions
1. A) The horseshoe vortex upstream of a cylinder in a laminar boundary layer has been visualized using smoke flow visualization. Three different types of vortex system have been observed which are, with increasing $UD/\nu$ :
	1. a) Steady horseshoe vortex systems with 2,4 or 6 vortices, the number of vortices increasing as $UD/\nu$ increases;	
	2. b) regular oscillatory motion
	3. c) irregular unsteady behaviour
2. B) Pressure distributions were measured on the plane of symmetry upstream of models of various types over a wide range of flow conditions $(2000 < UD/v < 16 000, 20 < D/\delta^{*} < 70)$. Two types of pressure distribution were measured.
	1. a) Pressure distributions which show minima. Flow visualization shows that such minima are at the position of the horseshoe vortex. ~={purple}Thus the vortex position can be determined from such pressure distributions. =~
	2. b) Pressure distributions which show no minima. Flow visualization shows that this type of pressure distribution occurs when the horseshoe vortex systems are unsteady.
3. C) $|x_{v}/D|$ increases as $UD/\nu$ increases and as $D/\delta^{*}$ decreases
	1. the horseshoe vortex position is not solely determined by this separation position but some other effect plays a part
4. D) As the Reynolds number UD/v increased steady horseshoe vortex systems began to oscillate intermittently and randomly at two different frequencies.
	1. As $UD/\nu$ increased further the periods of oscillation became longer, the high frequency oscillation becoming more common.
	2. At yet higher $UD/\nu$ the oscillations became irregular and the horseshoe vortex system became turbulent.
	3. These oscillations are not caused by vortex shedding in the wake of the models or by any small disturbances within the wind tunnel. It is concluded that ~={purple} the frequency of these oscillations is solely determined by the values of $UD/\nu$ and $D/\delta^{*}$. =~
5. E) A radial flow component can be measured only in vortices1 and 2, and appears to increase linearly with the distance from the centre of the vortex, in the central region of the vortex
6. F) The skin friction coefficient beneath vortex 1 was found to have a numerical value of five times its value far upstream of the cylinder, for $UD/\nu = 2610, D/\delta^{*} = 14.8.$
