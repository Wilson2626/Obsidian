# Abstract
1. Large eddy simulation(LES) is used to investigate the structure of ~={purple}the laminar horseshoe vortex (HV) system=~ and the dynamics of ~={purple}the necklace vortices=~.
2. Circular cylinder mounted on the flat bed of an open channel for Reynolds numbers defined with the cylinder diameter, D, smaller than 4460.
3. The structure of the HV system in the periodic breakaway sub-regime, which is ~={purple}characterized by the formation of three main necklace vortices=~. Over one oscillation cycle of the previously observed ~={purple}breakaway sub-regime=~	
	1. The ~={purple}corner vortex=~ and the ~={purple}primary vortex=~ merge (amalgamate)
	2. A ~={purple}developing vortex=~ separates from the incoming laminar boundary layer (BL) to become the new primary vortex.
4. Results show
	1. The classical breakaway sub-regime, in which one amalgamation event occurs per oscillation cycle, is present when the nondimensional displacement thickness of the incoming boundary layer(BL) at the location of the cylinder is relatively large $(\delta^{*}/D>0.1)$.
		1. $\delta^{*}$ : nondimensional displacement thickness
		2. $D$ : cylinder diameter
	
	2. A new type of breakaway sub-regime is present for low values of δ*/D.This sub-regime, which we call the double-breakaway sub-regime, is ~={purple}characterized by the occurrence of two amalgamation events over one full oscillation cycle.=~
5. relatively shallow flow conditions considered in this study (H/D ∼= 1, H is the channel depth)

# 1. Introduction
1. The flow past a surface-mounted bluff body is characterized by ~={purple}the formation of U-shaped necklace vortices=~ that wrap around its upstream base, ~={purple}separated shear layers (SSLs) on its sides=~ and ~={purple}a wake extending downstream=~.
2. The system of coherent necklace vortices forming at ~={purple}the junction between the bluff body and the bottom surface=~ under the influence of adverse pressure gradients is referred as the horseshoe vortex (HV) system.
